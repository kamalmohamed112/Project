        <h2>Advantage of using Operating System</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Allows you to hide details of hardware by creating an abstraction
                Easy to use with a GUI
            </li>
            <li>Offers an environment in which a user may execute programs/application</li>
            <li>The operating system must make sure that the computer system convenient to use</li>
            <li>Operating System acts as an intermediary among applications and the hardware components</li>
            <li>It provides the computer system resources with easy to use format</li>
            <li>Acts as an intermediator between all hardware's and software's of the system</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Disadvantages of using Operating System</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If any issue occurs in OS, you may lose all the contents which have been stored in your system</li>
            <li>Operating system's software is quite expensive for small size organization which adds burden on them. Example Windows</li>
            <li>It is never entirely secure as a threat can occur at any time</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What is Kernel in Operating System?</h2>
        <p>
            The kernel is the central component of a computer operating systems. The only job performed by the kernel is to the manage the communication between the software and the hardware. A Kernel is at the nucleus of a computer. It makes the communication between the hardware and software possible. While the Kernel is the innermost part of an operating system, a shell is the outermost one.
